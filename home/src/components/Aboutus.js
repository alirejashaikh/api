                    <p><marquee width="105%" direction="up" height="100%" >An online shopping cart is software that makes it possible for customers to select products and buy them online.
                       In a brick-and-mortar setting, a customer could browse, grab a product off the shelf, and head to the checkout counter to make a purchase. 
                       Or they could wheel a cart around the store to gather multiple products before checking out.
                       On an e-commerce website, customers need a way to mimic this experience. 
                       An online shopping cart allows them to select products on their computer or mobile device and store them in a virtual cart. From here, 
                       they can make their purchase..
                       Customers should have the opportunity to review their cart before making their purchase. 
                       They might decide they donâ€™t want a particular item, or want a different quantity, size, or color. 
                       They should be able to make these adjustments seamlessly, without leaving the cart.
                       The cart review process provides an opportunity for upselling. You can offer cross-product promotions, 
                       suggest products that pair well with items in their cart, or offer upgrades to their current selections. 
                       For example, if a customer is purchasing a nighttime skin serum, 
                       a prompt can offer a discounted price if they pair that serum with a daytime facial lotion.
                       <br/>
